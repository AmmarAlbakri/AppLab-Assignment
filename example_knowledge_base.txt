Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of 
human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their 
actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a 
human mind such as learning and problem-solving.​
 
Types of AI: There are three main types of AI: Narrow AI, General AI, and Superintelligent AI.​
 
Narrow AI: This type of AI is specialized in performing a single task. For example, a 
machine learning model that can recognize faces or play chess.​
 
​General AI: General AI would have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a 
human can do. It is still theoretical and has not been realized.​
 
Superintelligent AI: This type of AI surpasses human intelligence across all domains 
and is purely speculative at this point.​
 
Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms 
that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions based on that data. ML 
algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and 
reinforcement learning.​
 
Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural 
networks to simulate the workings of the human brain. DL models have been used in speech 
recognition, image classification, and natural language processing.​
 
AI Applications: AI is used in various fields such as healthcare (e.g., diagnostic systems), 
automotive (e.g., self-driving cars), finance (e.g., fraud detection), and entertainment (e.g., 
movie recommendation systems).
